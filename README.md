# üß¨ Abstract
RNA molecules localize to specific subcellular compartments to perform their functions. While most mRNAs are translated at the endoplasmic reticulum, many lncRNAs act within organelles. To better understand RNA localization mechanisms, we developed SRLE-seq (Screening RNA Localization Elements by Sequencing), a high-throughput method to identify functional localization elements.

## üìö Kmer-based library diversity validation
### 1.Introduction
This section is designed to validate whether the constructed Kmer-based plasmid library is suitable for downstream experiments. The distribution of plasmid types corresponding to each k-mer should be relatively uniform. No single k-mer type should dominate the library in abundance, as this would indicate amplification bias or cloning artifacts.


### 2.Input Requirements
The script accepts the following required command-line arguments:

| Argument         | Type     | Description                                              | Default |
|------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `-fq1`           | `str`    | Path to the nuclear sample R1 (forward reads) FASTQ file |         |
| `-fq2`           | `str`    | Path to the nuclear sample R2 (reverse reads) FASTQ file | None    |
| `-s`             | `str`    | Output directory for saving result figures and tables    |         |
| `-up_flanking`   | `str`    | Sequence of the upstream (5') anchor primer              |         |
| `-down_flanking` | `str`    | Sequence of the downstream (3') anchor primer            |         |
| `-kmer_length`   | `str`    | Length of k-mers to count                                |         |
> ‚ö†Ô∏è For paired-end reads with Paired-End sequences, at least one of the primer-binding regions should be longer than 150 bp. Otherwise, the reads should be merged using PEAR before further processing. 

### 3.Quick Start
Follow these steps to quickly analyse library diversity:
```angular2html
python kmer_diversity_validation.py \
  -fq1 R1.fastq \
  -fq2 R2.fastq \
  -s ./ \
  -up_flanking ATTATGAT \
  -down_flanking GCTTAGTG \
  -kmer_length 6 \
```

After completion, the output directory will contain:

kmer_diversity.validation.tsv ‚Äì records the raw count and CPM (counts per million) for each k-mer.

## üìç Kmer location analysis
### 1.Introduction
This section aims to investigate the subcellular localization preferences of individual k-mers following plasmid transfection into cells. As a prerequisite, quality control (QC) is performed on the post-transfection k-mer library. A k-mer is considered to pass QC if it shows a count-per-million (CPM) value greater than 1 in at least one of the three compartments: Total, Nuclear (Nuc), or Cytoplasmic (Cyto). This criterion ensures that the k-mer has been successfully transfected and exhibits sufficient expression for downstream analysis.

## üìç Randomfrag location analysis
### 1.Introduction
This section focuses on the subcellular localization patterns of full-length or partial sequence fragments after plasmid transfection. Quality control of the fragment library requires each fragment to have a minimum sequencing coverage of 100√ó, ensuring reliable detection and quantification. Only fragments meeting this coverage threshold are included in subsequent analyses to evaluate their abundance, CPM, and nuclear enrichment score (NES), which together provide insights into their subcellular distribution characteristics.
