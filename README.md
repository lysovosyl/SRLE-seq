# 🧬 Tookit for SRLE-seq data analysis

RNA molecules localize to specific subcellular compartments to perform their functions. While most mRNAs are translated at the endoplasmic reticulum, many lncRNAs act within organelles. To better understand RNA localization mechanisms, we developed SRLE-seq (Screening RNA Localization Elements by Sequencing), a high-throughput method to identify functional localization elements.

# ⚙️ Analysis modules

## 📚 1. Demultiplex

This script performs demultiplexing of paired-end FASTQ reads based on primer sequences. It identifies which library (or sample) each read pair belongs to by checking the beginning of R1 and R2 sequences for matching primer pairs, and then writes the matched reads into separate FASTQ files for each library.

### Input Requirements

The script accepts the following required command-line arguments:

| Argument   | Type    | Description                                                    | Default |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `-fq1`     | `str`   | Path to R1 FASTQ file                                          | -       |
| `-fq2`     | `str`   | Path to R2 FASTQ file                                          | -       |
| `-s`       | `str`   | Output directory for demultiplexed reads                       | -       |
| `-primer`  | `str`   | Primer list file containing library names and primer sequences | -       |


### Quick Start
Example of `primer.txt` (save this file in plain text format):
```text
lib1 TTCATACCTCTTATCTTCCTCCCACA TAAAACCTCTACAAATGTGGTATGGCTG
lib2 CTGGGCAACGTGCTGGTCTGT GGGGAGGTGTGGGAGGTTTTTTAAAG
lib3 TCATGTTCATACCTCTTATCTTCCT CCTCTACAAATGTGGTATGGCTGATT
```

Run the script with your FASTQ files and primer list:
```angular2html
python library_split.py \
  -fq1 /path/to/R1.fq \
  -fq2 /path/to/R2.fq \
  -s /path/to/output_dir \
  -primer /path/to/primer.txt
```

### Output

After the script finished, the output directory will contain:
```
output_dir
    └──lib1/
        ├── 1.fq   (R1 reads)
        └── 2.fq   (R2 reads)
    └──lib2/
        ├── 1.fq   (R1 reads)
        └── 2.fq   (R2 reads)
    └──lib3/

## 📚 2. Library diversity analysis (for 6-mer library)

This section is designed to validate whether the constructed Kmer-based plasmid library is suitable for downstream experiments. The distribution of plasmid types corresponding to each k-mer should be relatively uniform. No single k-mer type should dominate the library in abundance, as this would indicate amplification bias or cloning artifacts.

## 📚 4. NES calculation (for 6-mer library)

This section aims to investigate the subcellular localization preferences of individual k-mers following plasmid transfection into cells. As a prerequisite, quality control (QC) is performed on the post-transfection k-mer library. A k-mer is considered to pass QC if it shows a count-per-million (CPM) value greater than 1 in at least one of the three compartments: Total, Nuclear (Nuc), or Cytoplasmic (Cyto). This criterion ensures that the k-mer has been successfully transfected and exhibits sufficient expression for downstream analysis.

## 📚 5. NES calculation (for MALAT1 library)

This section focuses on the subcellular localization patterns of full-length or partial sequence fragments after plasmid transfection. Quality control of the fragment library requires each fragment to have a minimum sequencing coverage of 100×, ensuring reliable detection and quantification. Only fragments meeting this coverage threshold are included in subsequent analyses to evaluate their abundance, CPM, and nuclear enrichment score (NES), which together provide insights into their subcellular distribution characteristics.
